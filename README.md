    Welcome to my <a href="https://streamer.bot/">Streamer.Bot</a> Collection. Inside this project, you will find Actions and OBS Widgets that I use and create on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/blackywersonst">Livestreams</a>.
</p>

## 📦 Usage
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/BlackyWhoElse/streamer.bot-actions/releases) and add the index.html you need to your OBS. DONE (Easy right?)

## 📋 Support
As this repo is getting more and more attention it has become nessesary that all feature request and bug reports be added to the issues of this repo. Feel free to add issues yourself. Note: Yes I will consider makeing themes for widgets but they will be added as default themes to the collection.
